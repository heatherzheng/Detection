# Object Detection

Still in progress

The final form of the project would be a web. Users can choose the obejct they want to find in the video they upload, and the web would give the screenshot of the scene that has the object and give specific location.

The first version of the project would use faster-rcnn to do the detection work and the second version would use FPN+faster rcnn. (both trained by VOC2007)

Also users can choose to upload their own training dataset (can be as small as 40 images) and use haar classifier in opencv to find the object.
