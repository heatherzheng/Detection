# Object Detection

Still in progress

The final form of the project would be a web. Users can choose the obejct they want to find in the video they upload, and the web would give the screenshot of the scene that has the object and give specific location.

The first version of the project would use faster-rcnn to do the detection work and the second version would use yolo9000.
